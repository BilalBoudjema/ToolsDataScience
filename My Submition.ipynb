    "\n",
    "1. Addition: The `+` operator is used for addition. For instance, `2 + 3` evaluates to `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Subtraction: The `-` operator is used for subtraction. For example, `7 - 4` evaluates to `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multiplication: The `*` operator is used for multiplication. For instance, `5 * 6` evaluates to `30`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Division: The `/` operator is used for division. For example, `10 / 2` evaluates to `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Modulo: The `%` operator calculates the remainder after division. For example, `13 % 5` evaluates to `3`, as 13 divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Exponentiation: The `**` operator is used for exponentiation. For instance, `2 ** 3` evaluates to `8`, as it raises 2 to the power of 3.\n",
